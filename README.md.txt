# Portality: Content Management for ASP.NET MVC

### In short
Portality is a bare boned, lightweight CMS implementation that allows you to 
easily enable content editing for your new - or more important: *existing* - 
ASP.NET MVC applications. 

### Background information

There are numerous CMS implementations for ASP.NET MVC and, as you probably imagine, 
Portality is yet another one. It does have a major characteristic difference with lots 
of these other contributions in the sense that it is designed with one rule of thumb in 
mind: ditch the features and keep it simple & clean. 

The Portality project is initialized as a content editor with anorexia. Meaning we don't 
want to put in a gazillion of features by default. We don't want integration to require 
configuration files, setting up databases, running unreliable update scripts or training 
ourselves through endless pages of technical documents. We want content editing as simple 
as possible to integrate (for the developer) and provide the basic needs in the most 
straightforward user experience (for end users). And if the basics aren't enough, 
you - the developer - should be able to easily extend it at will.

Portality is a revamp of an old proof-of-concept project called "Cloudix".

###### Focus

In the development of Portality we target easy to integrate, easy to maintain, easy to 
upgrade by hanging on to the following principles:

* Making it as simple as possible to use, for both developer as well as end-user (KISS)
* No installations or complex configurations required
* Out-of-the-box functional, but extendable at will (open for extension, closed for modification)
* Single file assembly distribution: no external references or third party dependencies
* Pure ASP.NET MVC
